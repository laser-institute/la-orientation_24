# The Friday Institute for Educational Innovation

At The Friday Institute, **our mission is to advance K-12 education through innovation** in teaching, learning and leadership so that ALL students are prepared to succeed in a rapidly changing world.

- **Educate.** We conduct research, evaluation and professional learning.
- **Innovate.** We design supports, tools and structures for educational change.
- **Inspire.** We convene and collaborate with partners in education, government and private industries to inform standards, policy and practice.

The LASER Institute is a prime example of how we [Think and Do](https://www.ncsu.edu/think-and-do/) at the Friday Institute and we hope that you will carry this mission and vision forward!

# What is Learning Analytics? 

.pull-left[
LA seeks to understand and improve learning environments through new forms of digital data and techniques from data science and AI: 

- [Society for LA Research (SoLAR)](https://www.solaresearch.org/publications/hla-22/hla22-chapter1/) (Short Version)
- [Handbook of Learning Analytics](https://www.solaresearch.org/publications/hla-22/hla22-chapter1/)  (Medium Version)
- [Learning Analytics Goes to School](https://www.solaresearch.org/publications/hla-22/) (Long Version)

.panel[.panel-name[SHARK Goals]

Time and support is provided for scholars to develop a professional learning plan and work with your own data to further research goals.

> *I am thrilled to share with you all about a recently funded project that was influenced by my participation in LASER. I hope also to continue growing collaborations that have emerged out of this community!*

# LASER Institute Goals

.panelset[


.panel[.panel-name[This Year]

1. **Disciplinary Knowledge**: Deepen understanding of LA methodologies, literature, applications and ethical issues as they relate to STEM education and equity.

2. **Technical Skills:** Develop proficiency with R, Posit Cloud, and other tools for reproducible and collaborative data-intensive research.

3. **Social Capital:** Expand their professional networks, connecting with researchers and experts in LA related fields, as well as other scholars focused on STEM education.

]

.panel[.panel-name[This Week]

1. **Have fun.** Learning new methods can be rewarding but hard, especially when coding is involved, but we want to you enjoy yourselves this week.  
2. **Make Connections** We have an amazing groups of scholars participating this year, use this opportunity to get to know them better. 
3. **Develop a plan.** You won't become an expert in LA overnight, but we want to you leave Friday with a plan to continue learning and apply it to your research. 
4. **Earn two badges.** You'll be exposed to many new concepts and techniques this week, we want you to dig in and demonstrate what you've learned. 
5. **Provide Feedback.** We've revamped our curriculum and need your input to figure out what works well and how we can improve.

.panel[.panel-name[Today]

1. **Community Building (9:15)** - Affinity groups, badges and SHARK goals, oh my!
1. **Learning Lab Intros (10:00)** - Learn about reproducible research and the data-intensive research workflow in our LASER Learning Lab orientation.
1. **Lunch (12:30)** - Eat some great food, connect with new colleagues. 
1. **Scholar TA Panel (1:30)** - Meet three of our past scholars who'll be assisting  throughout the week and learn about their LA journey.
