## What is Reproducible Research? 

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}

In computational sciences like LA:
- Ideally... researchers can ***replicate*** your findings by following the procedures used to gather the data and run the computer code.
- Realistically... the data and code used to make a finding are available and sufficient to ***recreate*** the finding.

::: notes
**Speaker Notes:**

The information from this conceptual overview on reproducible research is drawn largely from the excellent book by Christopher Gandrud,Reproducible research with R and R studio. 

The distinction between these two definitions is that we recognize  it is sometimes difficult to replicate the original data set in a study because of issues such as limited resources to gather new data, or because the original study may have already sampled the full universe of cases.

**Network Models (Test & Predict)**

-   CONCOR

-   QAP

-   ERGMS

-   Regression
:::
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes:**

SNA like other research methods relies on the use of mathematical and/or computational models to succinctly represent the complexity of social relationships.

Descriptive measures such as size, centrality, reciprocity, and density are used to describe characteristics of individuals or groups in a network and the network as a whole. We'll explore these measures in Module 2.

SNA also has a wide range of statistical models tailored to working with relational data for hypothesis testing and building predictive models, which we'll explore Module 3.

# Key Terms

Actors, Ties, and Attributes

::: notes
**Speaker Notes:**

In this section we introduce some very basic terms that are essential for being able to conceptualize and discuss social networks. These terms encompass those are a part of a social network (actors), relationships between them (ties), and information about both (attributes).
:::

## Actors

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Also called **nodes** or **vertices**, actors can represent a range of social entities, like:

-   students in a classroom

-   teachers in a school district

-   parents in a community

-   school districts in a state

-   departments within a college
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![A classroom of middle school students [@pittinsky2008behavioral]](img/actors.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes:**

The important thing to note on this slide is that actors in social networks as represented by points or shapes on a graph don't necessarily have to represent single individuals, but can also represent collections of individuals, i.e. social entities.

This image is actual data that we'll be working with in this module. It comes from a study by Pittinsky and Carolan that examined the extent to which teachers' perceptions of student friendship networks agreed with those of their students and the implications for both researchers and practitioners.
:::

## Ties

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Also called **relations, edges**, or **links,** ties connect actors to one another and might consist of:

-   a behavioral interaction

-   a physical connection

-   an association or affiliation

-   an evaluation of one person by another

-   formal relations
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![The teacher's perception of student friendships as illustrated by lines (friendships) connecting dots (students).](img/ties.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes:**

Note that in the graph, these lines simply indicate whether a friendship does or does not exist according to the teacher. However, these links can also also capture the degree of relationship (e.g., friend, best friend) as well as the direction of a relationship, which would be indicated by arrows indicating who reported being friends with who.

\[Use the Notes Canvas in the Slide Tools or a handy nearby whiteboard to draw arrows on explain the difference between line with and without arrows\]
:::

## Attributes

::: columns
Finally, actors, ties, and the network as a whole may also contain information, which may be incorporated into visualizations or network models:

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Individual** attributes based on properties of individual actors (e.g., gender, academic achievement)

-   **Relational** attributes based on an actor's direct ties with others (e.g., degree, reciprocity, or tie strength)

-   **Structural** attributes based on the entire network of connections actors ties with others (e.g., density, centralization, or reciprocity)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![A sociogram incorporating network attributes](img/attributes.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes:**

Ask participants to take a look at the sociogram to the right and describe how some of these attributes have been incorporated into the graph.

Discuss how color has been used to indicate gender, how actors with more ties to each other are "clumped" in groups, how actors with more ties are larger as indicated by "local size," i.e. the number of students each student is connected to.
:::

## Discussion

Consider a small network you are a part of (\~ 5-10 individuals), or may be interested in studying, and think about the following questions:

1.  *Who are the actors in this networks?*
2.  *What types of ties might connect these actors?*
3.  *What individual attributes might be important to capture for SNA?*
4.  *Which actors may be more central (e.g. more ties) in this network?*

# Applications of SNA

Social Capital, Selection & Influence, Network Diffusion

::: notes
**Speaker Notes:**

In this section we'll introduce a few broad research areas where that have benefitted from the theoretical and methodological advances made by social network analysis, as well as some specific examples within the context of education.
:::

## Social Capital

Social capital is an intangible asset existing in the connections and shared values that people have. SNA provides a means to actually measure & model social capital and has be used to better understand:

-   how social relations advantages some students [@maroulis2008does]

-   dropout among Latino/a/ex students [@ream2008student]

-   parental social closure and student math achievement [@morgan2009intergenerational]

## Selection & Influence

Educational researchers have used to better understand why people connect (**selection**) and how these connections shape their opportunities and outcomes. Examples include:

-   who school leaders collaborate and confide in and why [@daly2010bridge]

-   how the characteristics of friends shape students' aspirations and college attendance [@hallinan1990students]

-   teachers' attitudes toward school and district reforms [@cole2010changes]

-   how friend influence and peer exposure widen the STEM gender gap [@raabe2019social]

-   development of peer networks and academic performance [@brouwer2022development]

## Network Diffusion

SNA has been used to explain how ideas and resources spread within and between networks of actors, such as:

-   attitudes and use of computers in classrooms over time [@frank2011focus]

-   how substance abuse diffuses across adolescent networks [@valente2004using]

-   diffusion of charter school policy and creation across states [@renzulli2005charter]

::: notes
**Speaker Notes:**

Note that we've rushed through a a lot of examples of SNA applications in a short amount of time but several of these we'll be exploring in greater depth through our readings and our case studies.

Also note that if you are interested in reading any of these articles, most are freely available online and linked on the references slide at the end of the presentation.
:::

## Closing Activity

Using the materials provided at your table or using a drawing tool on your personal laptop or device, create a simple sociogram of your network and think about the following questions:

1.  *How will you represent actors and their relationships?*
2.  *Where will you position the actors in your sociogram?*
3.  *How might you incorporate the attributes in your network?*
4.  *How might someone's position in this network advantage or disadvantage these individuals?*

::: notes
**Speaker Notes:**

If time is short, consider cutting this activity but do have a short discussion about how someones position in a network might be to their advantage or disadvantage.

## Essential Readings

The following chapters in @carolan2014 cover the topics introduced in this conceptual overview in much greater depth:

-   [Chapter 1: The Social Network Perspective and Educational Research Introduction](https://github.com/laser-institute/essential-readings/blob/main/sna-labs/sna-lab-1/carolan-network-perspective.pdf)

-   [Chapter 2: Historical, Theoretical, and Analytical Foundations](https://github.com/laser-institute/essential-readings/blob/main/sna-labs/sna-lab-1/carolan-history-theory.pdf)

-   [Chapter 3](https://methods.sagepub.com/book/social-network-analysis-and-education/n3.xml): [Basic Concepts](https://github.com/laser-institute/essential-readings/blob/main/sna-labs/sna-lab-1/carolan-basic-concepts.pdf)

In preparation for the Module 1 Code-Along and Case Study, the research article by @pittinsky2008behavioral is also highly recommended.
