        "Welcome to your first LASER Learning Lab Case Study! The case study activities included in each learning lab demonstrate how key Learning Analytics (LA) techniques featured in exemplary STEM education research studies can be implemented with Python. Case studies also provide a holistic setting to explore important foundational topics integral to Learning Analytics such as reproducible research, use of APIs, and ethical use of educational data.\n",

        "The final step in the workflow/process is sharing the results of your analysis with wider audience. Krumm et al. \\@krumm2018 have outlined the following 3-step process for communicating with education stakeholders findings from an analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Select.** Communicating what one has learned involves selecting among those analyses that are most important and most useful to an intended audience, as well as selecting a form for displaying that information, such as a graph or table in static or interactive form, i.e. a \"data product.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Polish**. After creating initial versions of data products, research teams often spend time refining or polishing them, by adding or editing titles, labels, and notations and by working with colors and shapes to highlight key points.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Narrate.** Writing a narrative to accompany the data products involves, at a minimum, pairing a data product with its related research question, describing how best to interpret the data product, and explaining the ways in which the data product helps answer the research question and might be used to inform new analyses or a \"change idea\" for improving student learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "In later Learning Labs, you will have an opportunity to create a simple \"data product\" designed to illustrate some insights gained from your analysis and ideally highlight an action step or change idea that can be used to improve learning or the contexts in which learning occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "For now, we will wrap up this case study by converting our work into a webpage that can be used to communicate your learning and demonstrate some of your new Python skills."
